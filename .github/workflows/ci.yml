  # sccache wraps rustc and caches individual compilation units.
  # CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 is required: incremental artifacts conflict with sccache.
  # SCCACHE_GHA_ENABLED is intentionally NOT set: with it enabled, sccache calls
  # the GHA artifact cache API on every rustc invocation — if the API is down the
  # server fails to start and the entire build fails.  Without it, sccache uses a
  # local disk cache; mozilla-actions/sccache-action saves/restores that cache via
  # actions/cache in its post-step, which is resilient to transient API outages.
